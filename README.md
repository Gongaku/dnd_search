# DND_Search
**Quickly search for something during your next session**

## Purpose
During my own sessions, I've found that I needed to quickly search up the effects for various player class features and of numerous spells. I always forget how to calculate my Spell DC for some reason...

This is meant as a means to alleviate that issue
